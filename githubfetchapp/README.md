I have completed the GitHub Fetch Application (for the most part).

Only thing that is left to complete is to make the application fully responsive.

Below will be a to-do list of any changes that I want to make in the future to the application so I won't spend too much time on a project after completing the basic component.

To-Do:
Make app responsive on all sizes
Make full GitHub information fit in div when full info button is clicked
